                        Halal meat available on request. Halal selection has never been better than this. Biriyanihut is now offering an ever-growing selection of Halal frozen foods. Halal meat is now as close and you will not be giving up the savory, authentic taste you expect from any food you order! 
                        Top quality Midwestern Halal leg of lamb, lamb shank, and lamb stew meat are full of flavor and rich in protein and other nutrients. Great for stews, roasting, barbeques and ethnic rice dishes like the famous and delicious biryani!

                        The interior looks like a typical Italian "trattoria": the owner, which is represented also on the window of the restaurant (if you go in you will immediately recognize him) will welcome you inside. The choice is very big: here is some advice: start with a ham bruschetta, and go on with beef cooked at your table on "hot rocks". Or start with a buffalo mozzarella and anchovies bruschetta (which will melt in your mouth) and them have pasta all'amatriciana" (with bacon, onion, tomato sauce and chili pepper).
